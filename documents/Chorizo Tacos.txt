Today at the party we have:

Smoky walnut cauliflower chorizo (honestly though, the texture! it’s crumbly and flavorful and delicious just like chorizo).

Juicy-sweet pineapple salsa loaded with jalapeno, lime, and cilantro.

Avocado mash, quick purple cabbage slaw, and a nice swish of chipotle mayo on top, all tucked into a roasted tortilla.

How about a big ol’ Y-E-S to that?

Okay, here’s a bonus: you can buy all these ingredients at ALDI. No joke, I added up the cost of my ALDI taco ingredients and compared it to the cost of the ingredients from a different grocery store.

Other store: $48.14
ALDI: $24.44
HELLO MONEY IN MY POCKET. Let’s buy all our stuff at ALDI – juicy fresh pineapple and jumbo bag of would-have-been expensive walnuts included!

THE MAKING OF VEGAN WALNUT CHORIZO TACOS
Alright, magical times ahead.

Cauliflower, walnuts, chipotles, and a pinch of spices. Pulse, bake, and you’re done.

Yeah, like if you haven’t done this yet, you haven’t really lived.

There are lots of other elements to this recipe – pineapple salsa, slaw, avocado mash, and chipotle mayo – and to me, all of them are necessary. What is the opposite of a taco minimalist? That is me. I want it all. Let’s do it all up.

But really, even though there’s a lot going on, it doesn’t take long. You know I have zero time for impractical food prep. While your cauliflower walnut taco meat bakes up, you are prepping all the stuffs. No biggie.

Then, you are stuffing the stuffs in a tortilla. With more stuffs.

Which brings us to this moment, where you’re grabbing a taco and drenching it with lime (more = more) and SERIOUSLY GOING TO TOWN.

These are my faaaaavorite tacos of summer, tied with these chicken tinga tacos. Between these two, Bjork and I cannot pick a winner.

SO MUCH LOVE TO THESE WALNUT CHORIZO TACOS! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!
